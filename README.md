University course timetabling is concerned with assigning a set of courses to a set of rooms and periods with respect to a set of constraints which are categorised into Hard and Soft constraints.
This problem has been tackled over the years using different metaheuristics approaches. And as such, Artificial Bee Colony algorithm was adopted for this project.
An attempt to solve this problem was made using datasets gotten from Federal University Wukari, Taraba state. Nigeria.
The Artificial Bee Colony was adopted as an optimizer for the solution.
